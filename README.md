### UBI Poll Tracker
How does the public feel about universal basic income? How does this vary by country or demographics? Does the phrasing and context of the question affect public opinion? As UBI has become more newsworthy—through political campaigns, pilots, and pandemic response policies—pollsters have researched these questions at length. While these single surveys reveal valuable insight, we sought to follow poll aggregators like FiveThirtyEight and show a broader representation, across time and demographics, of attitudes toward universal basic income.
